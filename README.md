Novacom C#
==========

This is a near-direct port of Novacom from Palm's source code and some 
disassembly, found within webOS SDK. All naming and behavior has been 
retained where possible, and changed to conform with C# coding 
standards. That means any code using Palm's Novacom Java API can be 
ported to C# without many changes needed.

Please note that the host computer running this code still requires 
novacomd to be installed, as this API communicates with novacomd, which 
in turn communicates with the device.
